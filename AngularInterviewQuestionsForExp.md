1. **Scenario: Dynamic Form Handling**
   - **Question:** Imagine you have a dynamic form with varying fields based on user roles. How would you dynamically generate and handle such forms in Angular?
   - **Answer:** I would create a dynamic form using the Reactive Forms module. Depending on the user's role, I'd dynamically generate form controls and adapt the UI to display the relevant fields. This allows for a flexible and role-specific form experience.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```typescript
     // Assuming you have a service to fetch dynamic form configuration based on user roles
     import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
     import { FormBuilder, FormGroup } from '@angular/forms';
     import { DynamicFormService } from 'path-to-dynamic-form-service';

     @Component({
       selector: 'app-dynamic-form',
       templateUrl: 'dynamic-form.component.html',
     })
     export class DynamicFormComponent implements OnInit {
       dynamicForm: FormGroup;

       constructor(
         private fb: FormBuilder,
         private dynamicFormService: DynamicFormService
       ) {}

       ngOnInit() {
         const formConfig = this.dynamicFormService.getFormConfig(); // Fetch dynamic form config
         this.dynamicForm = this.fb.group(formConfig);
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Scenario: Performance Optimization**
   - **Question:** You're working on a large-scale Angular application, and some pages have slower load times. How would you identify and address performance bottlenecks in your application?
   - **Answer:** I would use Angular's built-in tools like Angular CLI's performance profiler to identify slow components. Once identified, I might optimize rendering using OnPush change detection strategy, lazy loading modules, or implementing server-side rendering (SSR) for initial page loads.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```typescript
     // Example of using OnPush change detection strategy in a component
     import { Component, ChangeDetectionStrategy } from '@angular/core';

     @Component({
       selector: 'app-optimized-component',
       templateUrl: 'optimized-component.component.html',
       changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush,
     })
     export class OptimizedComponent {}
     ```

3. **Scenario: Real-time Data Updates**
   - **Question:** In an Angular application displaying real-time data, how would you ensure that the UI is updated instantly when the underlying data changes on the server?
   - **Answer:** I would use Angular's WebSocket support or a library like Socket.IO to establish a real-time connection with the server. Then, I'd update the UI using Angular's change detection or a state management solution like NgRx to reflect changes as soon as they occur on the server.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```typescript
     // Using WebSocket for real-time data updates in a service
     import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
     import { webSocket, WebSocketSubject } from 'rxjs/webSocket';

     @Injectable({
       providedIn: 'root',
     })
     export class RealTimeDataService {
       private socket$: WebSocketSubject<any> = webSocket('wss://your-real-time-server');

       getRealTimeData() {
         return this.socket$.asObservable();
       }
     }
     ```
